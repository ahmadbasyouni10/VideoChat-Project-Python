# VideoChat-Project-Python
This Video Chat Project uses Python to provide a video chat experience by utilizing the vidstream library and integrating threading to streamline the connection process and facilitate real-time video communication between devices. It is designed for both local and internet-based connections, offering flexibility in usage.

## Installation

Python installed (3.9 or higher)

Run these commands in terminal to install threading, vidstream: python library, tkinter: to create a UI, socket: for IP address handling
```
pip install vidstream
pip install tkinter
pip install socket
pip install threading
```

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine or download zip folder

Run main.py as the first device

Run main2.py from terminal by running this in terminal, which will be treated as your second device

Note this is a way to run both clients from the same device, but works when using 2 different computers

```
python main2.py
```

Steps: 

1: Use the same IP address of whoever is hosting, either first or second user's ip address

2: Ensure both clients are listening

3: Interact and take advantage of turning on camera, screen sharing, and talking
