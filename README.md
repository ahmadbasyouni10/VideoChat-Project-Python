# VideoChat-Project-Python
This project automates/scripts using python the compilation and organization of game source code files written in Go. It searches for directories containing the keyword "game," compiles the Go code within, and organizes the compiled games into a target directory.

## Installation

Python installed (3.9 or higher)

Run these commands in terminal to install threading, vidstream: python library, tkinter: to create a UI, socket: for IP address handling
```
pip install vidstream
pip install tkinter
pip install socket
pip install threading
```

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine or download zip folder
Run main.py as the first device
Run main2.py from terminal by running this in terminal, which will be treated as your second device
Note this is a way to run both clients from the same device, but works when using 2 different computers

```
python main2.py

```

Steps: 
1: Use the same IP address of whoever is hosting, either first or second user's ip address
2: Ensure both clients are listening
3: Interact and take advantage of turning on camera, screen sharing, and talking
